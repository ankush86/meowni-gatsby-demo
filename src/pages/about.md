# Hello Friend! I'm Nitin.

One day I tweeted too much about running or plant-based-diet and as Twitter penance I promised I would write a blog post about neural networking or fixing broken healthcare in the USA. I didn't have a blog, so here's one about things I find interesting, which may include, but not be limited to, mountains and dogs.

I'm an Enterprise Architect at [Blue Cross NC](https://www.bluecrossnc.com/), where I design, architect and implement various software systems to improve the life of our members, providers and our workforce. I'm responsible to develop technology strategies that accelerate technology transformations inductive to solving business challenges in the area of consumerization, externalization, affordability, and rapid time to market. I love to talk about the Server/Compute, Storage, Network, Unified Communications and Collaboration, big data and neural networking.

I do a [lot](https://trusting-williams-2a9d92.netlify.com/) of [pretty] [silly] side [projects](https://github.com/nitinkadam33/), mostly related to Machine Learning Engineering. 

I have a GitHub AMA [repo](https://github.com/nitinkadam33/ama) where you can ask me things, because I heard that's what the cool kids do nowadays. Or you can send me an [email](nitinkadam33@gmail.com). Or both.

Because the internet is a big place, standard disclaimers about these being my views and not my employer's apply.

### If you're a conference and you need a bio:

Nitin works on Neural Networking, Deep Learning web components, and Chrome, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you. He is unreasonably excited about running, plant-based-diet, traveling and will become your best friend if you have a dog. 

If you need a image, I recommend [this one](TBD)
