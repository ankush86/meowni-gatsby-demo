# Hello Friend! I'm Nitin.

One day I tweeted too much about running or plant-based-diet and as Twitter penance I promised I would write a blog post about neural networking or fixing broken healthcare. I didn't have a blog, so here's one about things I find interesting, which may include, but not be limited to, dogs.

I'm an Enterprise Architect at [Blue Cross NC](https://www.bluecrossnc.com/), where I design, architect and implement various software systems to improve the life of our members, providers and our workforce. 

I do a [lot](http://meowni.ca/posts/go-cat-dns-go/) of [pretty](http://meowni.ca/emojillate) [silly](http://meowni.ca/emoji-rain) side [projects](https://caturday-post.herokuapp.com/), mostly related to Machine Learning Engineering. I also [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf) a bunch at conferences about how to use technology to fix the broken healthcare in the USA.

I have a GitHub AMA [repo](https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama) where you can ask me things, because I heard that's what the cool kids do nowadays. Or you can send me an [email](nitinkadam33@gmail.com). Or both.

Because the internet is a big place, standard disclaimers about these being my views and not my employer's apply.

### If you're a conference and you need a bio:

Monica works on Polymer, web components, and Chrome, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you. She is unreasonably excited about emoji, wary of web fonts, and will become your best friend if you bring her cheese. On second thought, she may be a mouse.

If you need a image, I recommend [this one](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/779808817785675776/Hf9AwdFs_400x400.jpg)
